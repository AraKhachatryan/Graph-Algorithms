# Algorithms library for planar graphs (C++):

Graph represented as adjacency lists. Used STL containers and iterators. Implemented with OOP.

**Implemented algorithms:**
 - Depth-first search algorithm (making spanning tree of input graph)

 - Connectivity algorithm (determine whether a graph is connected and make graph's connected components vector)
 - Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm of weighted graph
 - Biconnectivity algorithm (determine whether a graph is biconnected and and make graph's connected components vector)
