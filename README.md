# Algorithms library for planar graphs (C++):

Graph represented as adjacency lists. Used STL containers and iterators. Implemented with OOP.

### Implemented algorithms:
 - **Depth-first search algorithm (making spanning tree of input graph)** <img  width="70%" height="70%" src="https://github.com/AraKhachatryan/Graph-Algorithms/blob/master/images/dfs_algorithm.png">
 - **Connectivity algorithm (determine whether a graph is connected and make graph's connected components vector)**
 - **Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm of weighted graph** <img  width="70%" height="70%" src="https://github.com/AraKhachatryan/Graph-Algorithms/blob/master/images/Dijkstra_algorithm.png">
 - **Biconnectivity algorithm (determine whether a graph is biconnected and and make graph's connected components vector)**
